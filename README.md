# blended
On occasion, stimuli generated within Blender 3-D creation suite require a corresponding set of python (.py) coding scripts to function as needed. I will deposit a number of these scripts, both old and new, as I hone or revise them over time. Perhaps they will be helpful to others seeking similar functionality.

Cheers.
