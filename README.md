# blended
On occasion, stimuli generated with Blender 3D creation suite require corresponding python (.py) programming language scripts to function as desired. I will deposit here a number of these scripts, those I have worked with, both old and new, as I hone or revise them over time. Perhaps they will be helpful to others seeking similar functionality.

Cheers.
